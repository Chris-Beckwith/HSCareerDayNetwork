Do we want to store Student addresses?
Do we want to store Student grade/year/graduation year?
Do we want to store Speaker addresses?
Can classrooms have an 'overflow'? IE. Max capacity is 30 but, could hold 35 if needed.
How would you like to add Subjects to Events at a School? 
    Drop down of existing subjects, with option to add new?
    For ease of use, it might make sense to have an option to add 'base' subjects to event.  IE common subjects.
    Was also planning to have a separate page to add Subjects.
Do we want to assign speakers a set of subjects?  Was going to have subjects attach to events, but I think it makes more sense to assign them to the speaker.
